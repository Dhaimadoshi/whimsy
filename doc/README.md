# Whimsy (framework) Documentation

Welcome to the Whimsy framework documentation!

Whimsy is currently composed of two parts:

- Autumn ([documentation][autumn-doc]): a parsing library
- Whimsy itself ([documentation][whimsy-doc]): a library for computing over ASTs
- Language-specific parsers and (bits of) compilers, using the above
    - Currently, only the Java 8 implementation is far along.
