# FAQ: What is the relationship between Autumn and PEGs?

If you don't know what Parsing Expression Grammars (PEG) are, you can read [my
description](../peg.md) of them.

PEG is a formalism that defines [some operators](../peg-ops.md) and their semantics. Autumn implements the formalism
but goes way beyond it. See [Why use Autumn?](why.md) to get an overview of what Autumn can do.
