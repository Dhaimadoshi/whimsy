# norswap.autumn.model

This package allows building an object graph model of a grammar. Such a model can be used to
generate an actual grammar, while using prettier notation (being unconstrained by inlining
restrictions).

In the future, we might use them to generate highly efficient grammar implementations.

See [this documentation page](/doc/autumn/faq/why-ugly.md) for some more context.
